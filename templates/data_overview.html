                <h3>Dataset Description</h3>
                <p>The dataset consists of over 30,000 texts collected from the internet and generated using precise prompts with the ChatGPT model. The use of generated texts, crafted to be informative and relevant, greatly aids in tasks like text classification as it ensures consistency and relevance without the complexities and legal concerns of web scraping. Moreover, generating texts with specific prompts is easier and more controllable than scraping the web for diverse data sources.</p>
                <p>To facilitate faster model learning and efficient processing, each text was truncated to 400 words. This choice was influenced by resource constraints, but extending the text length in future datasets could further improve model performance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="result-section">
                <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
                <p>The preprocessing pipeline includes several steps to ensure data quality and consistency:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Texts are cleaned by converting to lowercase, removing HTML tags, punctuation, digits, and normalizing unicode characters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lemmatization:</strong> Using the SpaCy library, texts are lemmatized to reduce words to their base forms, excluding stopwords, very short words, specific parts of speech, and named entities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Language Detection:</strong> Texts are filtered to include only English texts using the langdetect library.</li>
                    <li><strong>Truncation:</strong> Texts are truncated to 400 words to standardize input length and speed up model training.</li>
                    <li><strong>Padding:</strong> Texts are padded to ensure consistent input length during training.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frequency Analysis:</strong> To reduce bias and data leakage, words that appeared significantly more frequently in the works of individual authors compared to others were removed.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="result-section">
                <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
                <p>It is important to understand that the model may not be perfect for every topic in science and pseudoscience, but it encompasses a broad range of subjects included in its training. The original dataset had a length distribution ranging from short quotes (0-100 words) to extensive scientific publications (1000-10,000 words). This diversity allowed the inclusion of various types of texts after preprocessing, such as abstracts, introductions, conclusions, literature reviews, and complete independent texts. The primary goal was to diversify the types of collected texts and achieve almost a 1-to-1 topic match with the labels. However, this approach limited the number of topics in the training dataset. This issue was addressed during preprocessing and training to ensure the model could generalize from the training data to a wider range of text topics.</p>
